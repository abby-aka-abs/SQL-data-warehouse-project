# SQL Data Warehouse Project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution, covering the full lifecycle from raw data ingestion to actionable business insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it reflects industry-standard data engineering and analytics best practices commonly used in modern enterprise environments

## Project Overview

Data Architecture
Implemented a Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to design a scalable and maintainable SQL-based data warehouse.

Bronze Layer: Raw, ingested data stored with minimal transformation

Silver Layer: Cleansed, standardized, and enriched datasets

Gold Layer: Analytics-ready datasets optimized for reporting and insights

SQL ETL Pipelines
Developed robust SQL-based ETL pipelines to extract data from source systems, apply transformations, and load it into the warehouse. Emphasis was placed on data quality, consistency, and incremental processing.

Data Modeling
Designed fact and dimension tables using dimensional modeling principles (star schema) to support high-performance analytical queries and business reporting.

Analytics & Reporting
Built SQL-driven analytical queries, reports, and dashboards to surface key metrics, trends, and insights, enabling data-driven decision-making.
